# Nueral Networks
**Neural Network** is one of the significant algorithms to understand **DEEP LEARNING**. This method is base on the neural networks working in a **human brain**.
This algorithm solved many unsolvable problems in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**.
It was first introduced in  1943. The same year deep learning was introduced. We can say that the deep learning brain works on Neural Network Algorithm.

## What is NEURAL NETWORK
It has only three-layer 
1. Input Layer
2. hidden Layer
3. Output Layer

The **input layer** takes in the data feature. The **hidden layer** handles the calculation of ***weights*** according to the feature given for the input layer. Then the **output layer** gives out the result based on the calculation of the hidden layer.
There will be only one Input Layer and one Output Layer, but the hidden layer can consist of multiple layers based on the problems' complexity.
For example, a very famous model is used for image recognition called **VGG-16(Visual Geometry Group-16)** the no. Sixteen in this represent the layers present in this particular neural network.
There are 16 layers in this in which there is **one input layer** and **one output layer** and **14 hidden layers**.

## Weights
These weights are very important of the nueral networks. This hleps the NN to calculate thee output of the data feature.

Here the w represents the weights, X is the input from prev layer and b is the bias 
Initially the weights are initialize to random value but not zero (since the value is gettinh multiplid). 
Here the
