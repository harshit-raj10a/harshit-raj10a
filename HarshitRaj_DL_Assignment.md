# Nueral Networks
**Neural Network** is one of the major algorithms to understand **DEEP LEARNING**. This method is base on the neural networks working in a **huma brain**.
This algorithm solved many unsolvable problems in the feid of **Artificial Intelligence**.
It was firt introduce in  1943 the same year deep learning was introduced. We can say that deep learning brain works on Nueral Network Algorithm.

## What is NUERAL NETWORK
It has only three layer 
1. Input Layer
2. hidden Layer
3. Output Layer

The **input layer** taken in the feature of the data then the **hidden layer** handles the calculation of ***weights*** accodig to the featur given for input layer and then the **output layer** gives out the result based on the calculation of hidden layer.
There will be only one Input Layer and one Output Layer but HIdden layer can consist of multple layer based on the complexity of the problems.
For example, There is a very famous model used for image recognition called as **VGG-16(Visual Geometry Group-16)** the no. 16 in this represent the layers present in this particular nueral network.
There are 16 layers in this in which there is **one input layer** and **one output layer** and **14 hidden layer**.
