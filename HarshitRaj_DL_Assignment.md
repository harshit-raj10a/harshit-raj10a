# Nueral Networks
**Neural Network** is one of the major algorithms to understand **DEEP LEARNING**. This method is base on the neural networks working in a **huma brain**.
This algorithm solved many unsolvable problems in the feid of **Artificial Intelligence**.
It was firt introduce in  1943 the same year deep learning was introduced. We can say that deep learning brain works on Nueral Network Algorithm.

## What is NUERAL NETWORK
It has only three layer 
1. Input Layer
2. hidden Layer
3. Output Layer

The input layer taken in the feature of the data then the hidden layer handles the calculation of weights accodig to the featur given for input layer and then the output layer gives out the result based on the calculation of hidden layer.
